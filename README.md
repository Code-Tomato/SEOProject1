## Making Roommate Matching Easier!

## 📌 Overview

RoomieMatch is designed to help incoming college students find ideal roommates based on shared preferences and lifestyle habits. For many students entering their first year, the roommate assignment process can feel like a gamble. Some schools end up pairing students randomly, with little chance to interact beforehand. Others try searching through their school's class Instagram pages, but that can be time-consuming and overwhelming. 

Our CLI project takes the stress out of the process. By filling out a short profile, you’ll be matched with other students who align with your lifestyle. From there, you will be given a list of people who would pair good with you and, if you’re interested, send a intro email that is automatically generated by Gemini to save you time and make the first step easier!
